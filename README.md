# Ending the Gaza War Must Restore Our Humanity · The Virtuous City Vision · website

- `index.html`: the front page, the pitch slideshow; `full.html`: the full deck. Each links to the other. Click Next and Previous, use the arrow keys or the space bar, swipe on a phone, or click the left or right half of a slide. Each slide has its own link, for example `#mandate`.
- `virtuous-city-vision.pdf`: the PDF edition, linked from the slideshow's PDF button.
- `build-slideshow.py`: rebuilds `index.html` from the pitch export (`pitch/`) and `full.html` from the full deck export (`deck/`), each a deck.json plus slides/*.html. Run it after the deck changes, then copy in the fresh PDF.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a repository, for example `virtuous-city-vision`, and add `index.html`, `full.html` and `virtuous-city-vision.pdf` at the top level.
2. In the repository, go to Settings → Pages. Under Source, pick "Deploy from a branch", then choose `main` and `/ (root)`.
3. After a minute the site is at `https://<your-username>.github.io/virtuous-city-vision/`.

## A custom subdomain (optional)
1. In Settings → Pages → Custom domain, enter for example `virtuouscityvision.com` or a subdomain of it. This adds a `CNAME` file.
2. At your DNS provider, add a CNAME record from the subdomain to `<your-username>.github.io`.
3. Once the certificate is issued, tick "Enforce HTTPS".

The only thing the page loads from outside is its fonts, from Google Fonts.
